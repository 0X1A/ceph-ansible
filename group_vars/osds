# Devices to be used as OSDs
# You can pre-provision disks that are not present yet.
# Ansible will just skip them. Newly added disk will be

devices:
  - /dev/sdc
  - /dev/sdd

# Use 'None' to undefined the variable.
# Using 'None' will colocate both journal and data on the same disk
# creating a partition at the beginning of the device
